Abstract:
               <br><br><br><br><br>    This project explores the design and development of a leftover food notification app aimed at reducing food waste and promoting sustainable consumption. Utilizing design thinking principles, the app addresses the challenges faced by individuals and households in managing leftover food. Through empathy interviews and user journey mapping, we identified key user needs, such as reminders for consumption, sharing options with neighbors, and tracking food freshness . The app features customizable notifications for leftovers, a sharing platform to connect users within local communities, and educational resources on food preservation. Prototyping and user testing revealed valuable insights that guided iterative improvements, ensuring the app is user-friendly and effective. Ultimately, this app seeks to foster a culture of mindful eating and community engagement, contributing to broader environmental sustainability efforts</form>
