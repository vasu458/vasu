<text-color:"white">
Food waste is a significant global issue, with approximately one-third of all food produced being discarded each year. Many individuals and households struggle to manage their leftovers, often forgetting about them until they spoil. <br>
This not only contributes to environmental degradation but also leads to unnecessary financial loss.
<br> 
Existing solutions do not adequately address the need for timely reminders, community sharing options, or education on food preservation.
<br>

 Therefore, there is a pressing need for an intuitive app that notifies users about their leftovers, encourages sharing within local communities, and provides resources for effective food management, ultimately reducing food waste and promoting sustainable consumption practices.
<br>
Food waste is a pressing global issue, with millions of tons discarded each year, contributing to environmental harm and economic loss.
<br>

 Many households find it challenging to manage leftover food, often forgetting it until itâ€™s too late. 
<br>

This not only impacts their wallets but also exacerbates the problem of waste in land fills.
<br>

 In response to this challenge, we propose a leftover food notification app designed to help users efficiently track, manage, and utilize their leftover meals. The app offers customizable notifications to remind users of their leftovers, encouraging timely consumption and reducing spoilage. 

<br>
Additionally, it includes features for sharing surplus food with neighbors and local community members, fostering a sense of connection and reducing waste.
<br>
By leveraging technology and community engagement, this app aims to transform the way individuals approach food management, promoting sustainable consumption habits while addressing the critical issue of food waste.</h1>
